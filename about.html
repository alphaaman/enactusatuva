                                Giv2giv is a social venture designed to solve a critical problem: currently in the U.S.
                                large charities absorb the

                                majority of donated funds and are able to put them in an endowment for investment,
                                allowing
                                idle funds to “grow”;

                                however, smaller charities cannot do this and they are forced to put more energy into
                                seeking for funds constantly.

                                Giv2giv.org aims to make it possible for every person, every organization, regardless of
                                their net worth, to be able to

                                have a “mini endowment” that grows overtime and eventually become self­sustainable.
